# Patient Waiting Times: Underlying Factors

This project was completed as the first dissertation project for my Master's in Statistics with Science at the University of Edinburgh. 

### Context
The demand in health and social care systems has been constantly increasing over the years with
the increasing population which pushes the limits of existing facilities. The underlying key factors of
patient inflows and acting in a proactive manner is crucial. Public Health Scotland (PHS) is concerned
about the service in the acute part of Scotland Health System and they would like to model patient
counts. This project investigates key factors of the number of people waiting in at speciality and health
board level, suggests a model which captures the behaviour of the number of waiting patients in the
system, gives insights based on the fitted model parameters.

### Models
Quasi-Poisson Regression and Poisson Regression with Random Effects models are investigated based on the characteristics of the data.
